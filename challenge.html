                The number of web applications being created and used has grown rapidly since the new millenium. And
                importantly, so has the sheer complexity of them - specially on the front end. No more static pages, no
                sir!

                You have a ton of sections eachinteracting with each other and the server and yes, it's as complicated

                sounds and just as hard to put off. Today, I'd like to talk about a few, choice JavaScript fameworks
                that
                aim to simplify front end application development.
